/*
Coding Challenge #1
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
Â§ Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall.
Â§ Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
m tall.
GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

// let johnBMI = johnMass / johnHeight ** 2;

// console.log(johnBMI)

// let markHeigherBMI = marksBMI > johnBMI;
// console.log(markHeigherBMI)


// // Test 2
marksMass = 95;
marksHeight = 1.88;

marksBMI = marksMass / marksHeight ** 2;

console.log(marksBMI);

johnMass = 85;
johnHeight = 1.76;

// Coding Challenge #2
/* Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and
improve it.
Your tasks:
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message
is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
Hint: Use an if/else statement ðŸ˜‰ */

if (marksBMI > johnBMI) {
    console.log(`Marks BMI ${marksBMI} is higher than Johns ${johnBMI}`)
} else {
    console.log(`John BMI ${johnBMI} is higher than Marks BMI ${marksBMI}`)
}
